The purpose of Uniflow is to workflow your microtasks. You have to :
- Identify in your everyday life, you can think about tasks that are recurring.
- Figure about if a small task will take less time to automate than doing it straight.

This project is based on [flow programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming).
And is largely inspired by many projects : 
- [NoFlow](https://noflojs.org/)
- [Workflow](https://workflow.is/)
- [Google Blocky](https://developers.google.com/blockly/)
- [nvAlt](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/)

Here, you can customise your own task and create your own specific modules into one normalised [SAAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) interface.
