title: Naming a Client
---

A Client can be anything, as soon as it connect one or more Bridges and
make a link it to Uniflow.

So it's chosen name must fit what the Client does.

As each Client is implemented for any language, only `package.json` file
is required at root of the project Client directory.

This will identify the Client by specifying a **name** field in you
Client's `package.json`
