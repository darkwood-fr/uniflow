title: Naming a Client
---

A client can be anything, as soon as it connect one or more bridges and make a link it to Uniflow.

So it's choosen name must fit what the client does.

As each client is implemented for any language, only `package.json` file is required at root of the project client directory.

This will identify the client by specifying a **name** field in you client's `package.json`
