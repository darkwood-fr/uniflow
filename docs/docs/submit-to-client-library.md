title: Submit to Client Library
---

In order to add your client to the [Client Library](https://uniflow.io/clients), you need to :

1. Publish a package to npm (learn how on the [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages)).
2. Include a `uniflow-client` as  **keywords** field in you client's `package.json`
3. Document your client with a `README.md`
