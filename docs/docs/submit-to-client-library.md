title: Submit to Client Library
---

In order to add your Client to the [Client Library](https://uniflow.io/clients), you need to :

1. Publish a package to npm (learn how on the [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages)).
2. Include a `uniflow-client` as  **keywords** field in you Client's `package.json`
3. Document your Client with a `README.md`
