## Why ?

Workflow your micro

## How ?

Think macro, act micro

## Mono Flow, the inspiration

I am very big fan of doing NoFlow, Workflow for iOS, IFTTT, Automator,
Zapier, Datafire, Huggin and Google Blockly. The flow programming is very
interesting because you assemble blocs like Lego pieces. What can become
complicated is when you assemble its too much because you get a graph
like spaghetti. So, I made the choice to make it human readable and to
have your flow ordered by a single list. As human, we like lists. it's
common and anchor into our usage, affordable and natural to read from
top to bottom. At the end, you can make anything into each block, so
have conditions, loops and so on as long as something is delivered at
the end. For the interface, I also did pick up the philosophy of nvALT.

## What content it deserve

The goal is to deserve everything. So, a block can be a simple text
transformation as it can be a very specific process. The harmony is
important to have a base that allows to mix blocks together. Only the
security is the topmost priority that must be checked.
