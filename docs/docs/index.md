#### Why ?

Workflow your micro

#### How ?

Think macro, act micro

#### Mono Flow, the inspiration

I did really like NoFlow, Workflow for iOS, IFTTT, Automator, Zapier,
Huggin, google Blocky. The flow programming is very interesting,
because you assemble blocs like legos. What can become complicated is
when you assemble too much and you got a graph like spaghetti. So I did
make a choice to make it human readable and have your flow ordered by a
single list, as human we like list it's common, anchor into our usage,
affordable and natural to read from top to bottom. At the end you can
make anything into each block, so have conditions, loops and so on as
long as something is delivered at the end. For the interface, i also did
pickup the philosophy of nvALT

#### What content it deserve

The goal is to deserve realy anything. So a block can be a simple text
transformation as it can be a very specific process. The harmony is
important for having a base to allow mix blocks together. Only the
security is the top most priority to be checked.
