## Why ?

Workflow your microtasks

## How ?

Think macro, act micro

## Mono Flow, the inspiration

I did realy like, and a very fan of NoFlow or Workflow for iOS,
IFTTT, Automator, Zapier, Huggin, google Blocky. The flow
programming is very interresting, because you assemble blocs
like legos. What can become complicated is when you assemble too
much and you got a graph like spagety. So i did make a choice to
make it human readable and have your flow ordered by a single
list, as human we like list it's common, anchor into our usage,
affordable and natural to read from top to bottom. At the end
you can make anything into each blocks, so have conditions,
loops and so on as long as something is delivered at the end.
For the interface, i also did pickup the philopsophy of nvALT

## What content it deserve

The goal is to deserve realy anything. So a block can be a
simple text transformation as it can be a very specific process.
The harmony is important for having a base to allow mix blocks
together. Only the security is the top most priority to be
checked.
