Here we jump to the simplest case study : sort lines !

Say you are preparing your new teacher season. Each year, your principal send you the list of all your study classes and each contains your pupils names at any order.
So you open your favorite text editor and just sort all people name by hand.

Why does it have to be so time consuming. You are in front of a computer, it can do it automatically.

There come Uniflow at your help.

[Look at the nice Flow we created](https://uniflow.io/public/feed/simple-sort-line)

In this Flow, you just copy all you pupils names in any order, then you push "Play button".
Tada 🍿 all names were sorted in alphabetical order at the end.
Copy the result and report it to your text selection.

You are done !
