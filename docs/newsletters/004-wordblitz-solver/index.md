Did you ever face your friends on funny smart games ? Sometimes you just want show your victory over your friends.
Let me introduce Wordblitz, a Facebook crossword game, where the most world you found in a limited time, the more points you score. The winner is the one with the most points.

I do not know all worlds in the word and I hate time limited games based on reactivity. I ask myself : we already got dictionary, why do not let a computer search all the worlds for me.

Here come Uniflow at help :
