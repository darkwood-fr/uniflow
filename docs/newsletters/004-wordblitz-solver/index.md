Did you ever face your friends on funny smart games?  
Sometimes you just want to show your victory over your friends.

Let me introduce Wordblitz, a Facebook crossword game.  
Rules are simple: the most world you found in a limited time, the more points you score.  
The winner is the one with the most points.

I don't know all the words in the word and I hate time-limited games based on reactivity.  
I ask myself: we already got a dictionary, why do not let a computer search all the worlds for me.

Here comes Uniflow to help :

**[Look at the flow we created https://uniflow.io/public/feed/wordblitz-solver](https://uniflow.io/public/feed/wordblitz-solver)**

You enter the board that you see when the game start, then choose your dictionary language.  
On *"Play button"* pressed, Uniflow will show you all the world that you can find sorted by points.

If you are quick enough then you should easily win against anyone!

Happy Flowing ðŸš€
