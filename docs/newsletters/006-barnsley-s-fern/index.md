Did you feel getting an artist fiber ?  
With the computer, some remarkable art can be generated with simple formulas.  
Here, we get a closer look to *Barnsley fern*.  
This is a fractal named from the British mathematician Michael Barnsley.  
The Barnsley fern shows how graphically beautiful structures can be built from repetitive uses of mathematical formulas with computers.

Uniflow helps you develop your imagination by stacking the rights Flows and allows you to directly focus on the generation process.
