A Client is a key part of Uniflow 💧 concept and it is essential to understand his job.

A Client has one job 🦄, and is job is to do it well ✨ at the more detail 🚀 and fastest ⚡️ way possible, no matter the cost 💥.

This is why so many clients will never be enough ⚔️.

And what if : we mixed all the clients together ?

This is obvious to say that, but it allows to see things at another next level.

For instance, if I decide to write a new flow, why this specific flow can't have the similarity implemented in various clients ?

The underling concept here is to create a unified paradigm context for multiple distinct and specific clients.

Moreover, a new dedicated [Client](https://uniflow.io/clients) 🦄 section is now open to list all available clients. To get more information about client, refer to the [Doc](https://uniflow.io/docs) 📚.

All this is now possible at Uniflow 💧 today 🚀.

Happy flowing. 🌟🎉
