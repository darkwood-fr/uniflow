Uniflow did an internal refactoring for the Client. 💪  
This was a long migration from [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org) to [React Context](https://fr.reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

This allow to remove React Redux dependancy and migrate all the code on official React way to manage state in React components. 🏗  
Meanwhile, there are no more Class Components and Functionnal Components is the prefered way to use in development.  
This way we can use [Hooks](https://fr.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) inside our Functionnal Components.

Happy flowing. 🎉
