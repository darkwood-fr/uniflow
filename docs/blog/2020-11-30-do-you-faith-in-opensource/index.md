In Open Source, I mean Open Source Software commonly shortcuted as *OSS*.  
But this article can be extended for various open contribution types.

Coding for *passion* and *altruism* is good and fun ! **But not all code value the same**.  
You can be the best developer in the world get the best ideas : then fine! ‚≠êÔ∏è  
But if you are developping for **FREE** a software that is part of your *core business* then you can at least receive people gratitude for what you have done.

It's not only about code and gratitude. ‚ù§Ô∏è  
It's also about money. üí∏   
As people, we live, we aford houses, we pay taxes, we grow up familly, we just can't live from clean air and fresh water. üíß

That's why Uniflow now join [fair-code license](https://faircode.io), this allow us to financially protect our work while beeing totally transparent to our community.  

Moreover, Uniflow depends on lot of other open source projects. We care about the work they contributed for us and is only fair that we support them back.  
That is why we have planned to contribute a certain percentage of revenue/profit every month to these projects.

For any questions about Uniflow License, we cover more details into the [FAQ](https://uniflow.io/docs/faq#which-license-does-uniflow-use).  
If you have any questions about this, feel free to reach out to us at contact@uniflow.io.

Happy flowing. üéâ
