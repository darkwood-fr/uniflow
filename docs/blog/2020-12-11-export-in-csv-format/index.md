As the new year is approaching, may you decide to make a great video chatting party! ðŸ¥³

To keep things organized, you decide to make a list of people that are willing to come. ðŸ™Œ  
But it will be nice to share this list on [CSV format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values).  
In that way, you could work on your data directly on your favorite spreadsheet tool.

[Have a look a the export CSV template we made for you.](https://uniflow.io/public/feed/export-csv)

Here, you just fill people's information, then click on `Play` Button.  
The CSV file will be generated for you.  
Do not hesitate to customize the template to fill your need! ðŸ’ª

Happy flowing. ðŸŽ‰
