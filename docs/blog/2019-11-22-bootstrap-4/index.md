Uniflow get a new fresh design 🎉 !

We choosed flat design as the purpose is to get strait into the data flow ⚡️.

At the same time we wanted a more spaced interface, to make things more Hero content 🦄.

Boopstrap 4 was choosen to focus on responsive, mobile-first site 📱.

More over, the [Blog](https://uniflow.io/blog) 📝 and [Doc](https://uniflow.io/docs) 📚 sections are now part of the site.
Everyone can contribute to theses on [Github](https://github.com/uniflow-io/uniflow)
