                <h3>Why ?</h3>
                <p>
                    We all have someone or multi-person that will continously harras you at work for no reason.
                    Just for pretending working and for having this ego fullfilled with the team and impress his boss to gain only at the end 0.5% pay rise per year, he will use you and ask you anything possible.
                    He has no idea how to resolve the issue, but you stick a part of the whole hierachy then you have no choice but keep going to smile and accept the dirty work.
                    Meanwhile every member of the team is playing nerf in a good mood at the open-space, you are not. But you have to pretend working and you just don't give a single shit of your work.
                    No person will make your work, and every body will pretend having to much to do, but do nothing in reality.
                    It's like master / slave communication and you never, ever can't break the rule since you have not a position in the company.
                    You are stuck to work gain the dam pay mounth money and for preserving your survival in society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So that's how this projet come to live. The goal is to delegate. Delegate to who ? The computer ...
                    The computer may be the only domain that is virtual. Counter to the contruction builing for instance (the reality), you have a computer in your hand, and you easily can create, destroy, do, cancel, redo things in one mouse click.
                    In your dirty work you will identify parts of your jobs that you can reproduce, then automate micro tasks in for your daily and boring todo list that you never care but end the day and go home.

                <h3>Mono Flow, the inspiration</h3>
                <p>
                    I did realy like, and a very fan of NoFlow or Workflow for iOS, IFTTT, Automator, Zapier, Huggin, google Blocky.
                    The flow programming is very interresting, because you assemble blocs like legos.
                    What can become complicated is when you assemble too much and you got a graph like spagety.
                    So i did make a choice to make it human readable and have your flow ordered by a single list, as human we like list it's common, anchor into our usage, affordable and natural to read from top to bottom.
                    At the end you can make anything into each blocks, so have conditions, loops and so on as long as something is delivered at the end.
                </p>

                <h3>Javascript</h3>
                <p>
                    I specialy choose Javascript, because it's actualy for me the only language that is large covered for any device this can work on browser, mobile and desktop and can have native part bridge integration.
                    More over Javascript has a very simple curve to learn and can also be high to master.
