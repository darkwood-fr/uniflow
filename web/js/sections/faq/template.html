                <h3>Why ?</h3>
                <p>
                    We all have someone or multi-person that will continously harras you at work for no reason.
                    Just for pretending working and for having this ego fullfilled with the team and impress his boss to gain only at the end 0.5% pay rise per year, he will use you and ask you anything possible.
                    He has no idea how to resolve the issue, but you stick a part of the whole hierachy then you have no choice but keep going to smile and accept the dirty work.
                    Meanwhile every member of the team is playing nerf in a good mood, you are not. But you have to pretend working and you just don't give a single shit of your work.
                    No person will make your work, and every body will pretend having to much to do, but do nothing in reality.
                    It's like master / slave communication and you never, ever can't break the rule since you have not a position in the company.
                    You are stuck to work gain the dam pay mounth money and for preserving your survival in society.
                </p>

                    So that's how this projet come to live. The goal is to delegate. Delegate to who ? The computer ...
                    The computer may be the only domain that is virtual. Conter to the contruction builing for instance, you have a computer in your hand, and you easily can create, destroy, do, cancel, redo things in one mouse click.
                    In your dirty work you will identify parts of your jobs that you can reproduce, then automate micro tasks in for your daily and boring todo list that you never care but end the day and go home.
