UNIFLOW
=======

The purpose of Uniflow is to workflow your microtasks. You have to :
- Identify in your everyday life, you can think about tasks that are recurring.
- Figure about if a small task will take less time to automate than doing it straight.

This project is a combinaison on [Flow Based Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming) and [Railway Oriented Programming](http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/) newly named as [Railway Flow Based Programming](https://medium.com/@anton.mishchuk/railway-flow-based-programming-with-flowex-ef04fd338e41).
